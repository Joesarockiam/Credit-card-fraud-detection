# Credit Card Fraud Detection System
## Project Overview
## Aim
This collaborative project, undertaken by Joes Arockiam X (ID: 2133020) and Sanjay V V (ID: 2133038), is submitted to the Department of Computing at Coimbatore Institute of Technology. The project aims to develop an advanced credit card fraud detection system using predictive analysis techniques. By leveraging data analytics algorithms, the goal is to enhance security measures and mitigate financial losses associated with credit card fraud. The project focuses on building a robust predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives.

## Abstract
Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge, costing an estimated $28.6 billion globally in 2022. Fraudsters employ various methods, such as phishing and card cloning. This project utilizes machine learning techniques, including time series analysis, clustering, and discriminant analysis, to combat credit card fraud. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is introduced to reduce dataset dimensionality and enhance the accuracy of machine learning models.

## Project Concept
The project revolves around leveraging predictive analysis techniques to develop a credit card fraud detection system. By analyzing historical credit card transaction data, meaningful patterns are extracted to train a predictive model. The ultimate goal is to build an accurate and efficient system that identifies and prevents fraudulent transactions in real-time, contributing to improved security measures in the financial industry.

## Dataset
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle.com ("Credit Card Fraudulent"), serves as the foundation for model training and evaluation.

## Packages Used
#### Numpy
####  Pandas
####  Statsmodels
####  Scikit-learn
####  Matplotlib
####  Seaborn
## Code and Outputs
The project code includes data preprocessing, time series analysis (ARIMA model), PCA, clustering (K-means), and discriminant analysis (SVC model). Notable outputs and inferences are highlighted after each analysis step.

## Conclusion
The project's conclusion emphasizes insights gained from each analysis, such as the ARIMA model's forecasting capabilities, PCA revealing limited variance patterns, K-means clustering identifying distinct segments, and the SVC model achieving high accuracy but with room for improvement in recall rates.
